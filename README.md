# Hospital-Performance-Dashboard

## Overview
### Healthcare Analysis with Power BI
This project analyzes New York state-wide hospital discharge data for elective hip replacement surgeries. The goal is to uncover factors affecting hospital efficiency, focusing on Length of Stay (LOS) and related costs. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights key insights, trends, and improvement opportunities to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare management.

## Key Features
- Total Hospitals: Insights from 151 hospitals with 627 surgeons.
- Average Length of Stay (LOS): The average LOS across hospitals is 2.65 days.
- Total Discharges: A total of approximately 26,000 discharges.

### Key Metrics
- Highest Average LOS: 
  - Kings County Hospital: 12.0 days
  - Interfaith Medical Center: 9.3 days
  - Memorial Hospital: 9.1 days

- Lowest Average LOS: 
  - Alice Hyde Medical Center: 1.7 days
  - St. Elizabeth Medical Center: 1.6 days
  - Northern Dutchess Hospital: 1.4 days

### Cost Analysis
- Total Cost: Approximately 549.6 million
- Total Charges: Approximately 1.6 billion
- Average Cost Per Discharge: 20.9K

### Demographics Insights
- Cost by Gender: 
  - Female: 53.98%, Male: 46.02%

- Cost by Age Band: 
  - Age 50+: 90.49%, Age <50: 9.51%

### Discharge Analysis
- Total Discharges by Severity of Illness: 
  - Moderate: 13.3K, Minor: 11.7K, Major: 1.2K, Extreme: 0.1K

### Patient Disposition Analysis: 
  - Home with Home Health: 55.01%
  - Home or Self Care: 20.5%
  - Skilled Nursing Home: 19.3%

## Factors Impacting Length of Stay (LOS)
  - Severity of Illness: Extreme severity â†’ LOS up to 8.9 days.
  - Risk of Mortality: Major/Extreme risk increases LOS significantly.
  - Facility Influence: Some hospitals consistently show longer LOS despite similar case mixes.
  - Patient Disposition: Transfers to Skilled Nursing Facilities or Rehabilitation centers linked with longer LOS.

## Opportunities for Improvement
  - Target high-LOS facilities (e.g., Kings County, Interfaith) for efficiency audits.
  - Early discharge planning for patients likely to transition to skilled care.
  - Optimize resource allocation for high-risk and extreme severity patients.
  - Benchmarking best practices from hospitals with shortest LOS while maintaining quality care.
  - Age-specific care pathways to manage higher costs in 50+ age group.
